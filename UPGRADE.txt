Aegir 0.2 upgrade instructions
==============================

This document describes briefly how to upgrade existing Aegir
platforms.

Upgrading Hostmaster from 0.1
-----------------------------

Upgrading hostmaster should be as simple as removing the provision and
drush modules from your profiles/hostmaster/modules directory. You
also need to create a new drush and provision checkout. Finally, you
can remove the drush.php symlink.

Shell commands::
 cd /var/aegir
 cvs co -d drush  contributions/modules/drush
 mkdir .drush
 cvs co -d .drush/provision  contributions/modules/provision
 rm drupal-5.x/drush.php

You will need to put the path to that new drush in the webserver node
configuration. Rerunning the wizard will prompt you for that.

Upgrading Hostslave platforms from 0.1
--------------------------------------

Provision has been migrated out of the platforms. It used to be
installed in the profiles/hostslave/modules directory. It is now in
~/.drush/provision. So you can simply cleanup the hostslave profile
and the virtual host created for the hostslave profile. You can also
remove the drush symlink.

Shell commands::
 cd /var/aegir
 rm -r drupal-6.x/profiles/hostslave
 rm config/vhost.d/hostslave
 rm drupal-6.x/drush.php

You should also delete the database created during the hostslave
install:

SQL commands::
 DROP DATABASE hostslave;
