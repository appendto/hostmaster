The Aegir system
================

This install profile is part of the front end of a system that also
consists of the hosting framework (front end) and the provisioning
framework (backend).

The front end and back end are designed to be run separately, and each
front end will also be able to drive multiple back ends (in the
simplest case, each drupal release will be a back end implementation
of it's own)

Once installed go to admin -> help -> hosting for more elaborate and
translatable help.

The most up to date information regarding the project and it's goal
can be found in the Aegir wiki page -
http://groups.drupal.org/aegir/overview .

Install instructions are in INSTALL.txt. If you are upgrading from a
previous version of Aegir, see UPGRADE.txt.
